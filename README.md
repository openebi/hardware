# OpenEBI Printed Circuit Board

OpenEBI is an open source project to measure electrical bioimpedance (EBI) using four-electrode technique. The hardware implements an AD5933-based spectrometer. Both magnitude and phase can be measured at the frequency range from few kilohertz up to 100 kHz. This is the GitHub repository of OpenEBI hardware. The software is located at https://github.com/openebi/software.

__IMPORTANT! OpenEBI is intended for scientific use. Persons handling these design materials or the assembled printed circuit board must have electronics training in medical electronics and observe good engineering practice standards.__
